We at PryanetShare love it when people talk about PryanetShare, build 
businesses around PryanetShare and produce products that make life 
better for PryanetShare users and developers. We do, however, have a 
trademark, which we are obliged to protect. The trademark gives us 
the exclusive right to use the term to promote websites, services, 
businesses and products. Although those rights are exclusively ours, 
we are happy to give people permission to use the term under most 
circumstances.

The following is a general policy that tells you when you can refer 
to the PryanetShare name and logo without need of any specific 
permission from PryanetShare:

First, you must make clear that you are not PryanetShare and that you 
do not represent PryanetShare. A simple disclaimer on your home page 
is an excellent way of doing that.

Second, you may not incorporate the PryanetShare name or logo into 
the name or logo of your website, product, business or service.

Third, you may use the PryanetShare name (but not the PryanetShare 
logo) only in descriptions of your website, product, business or 
service to provide accurate information to the public about yourself.

Fourth, you may not use the PryanetShare graphical logo.

If you would like to use the PryanetShare name or logo for any other 
use, please contact us and we’ll discuss a way to make that happen. 
We don’t have strong objections to people using the name for their 
websites and businesses, but we do need the chance to review such use.
Generally, we approve your use if you agree to a few things, mainly: 
(1) our rights to the PryanetShare trademark are valid and superior to 
yours and (2) you’ll take appropriate steps to make sure people don’t 
confuse your website for ours. In other words, it’s not a big deal, 
and a short conversation (usually done via email) should clear 
everything up in short order.

If you currently have a website that is using the PryanetShare name and
you have not gotten permission from us, don’t panic. Let us know, and 
we’ll work it out, as described above.
